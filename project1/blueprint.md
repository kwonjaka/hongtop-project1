# Lotto Number Generator

## Overview

This is a simple web application that generates a set of random lottery numbers. The application will have a button that, when clicked, will display a new set of 6 unique numbers between 1 and 45.

## Design and Features

*   **Modern UI:** The application will have a clean and modern user interface with a visually appealing layout.
*   **Responsive Design:** The layout will be responsive and work on both desktop and mobile devices.
*   **Color Palette:** A vibrant color palette will be used to make the application look energetic.
*   **Typography:** Expressive typography will be used to emphasize key information.
*   **Interactivity:** The "Generate" button will have a shadow and glow effect.

## Current Plan

1.  **Update `index.html`:** Create the basic structure of the application with a title, a container for the numbers, and a "Generate" button.
2.  **Update `style.css`:** Add styles to implement the modern UI design.
3.  **Update `main.js`:** Implement the lottery number generation logic and the event listener for the button.
